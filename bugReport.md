# Bug Report

## Critical
- *No critical bugs reported.*

## Warning
- **2024-07-22**: On very fast, repeated clicks, the transition animation can sometimes get stuck. Need to add more robust input debouncing.
- **2024-07-22**: The Tweakpane UI can feel slightly sluggish when adjusting parameters during an active transition.

## Suggestion
- **2024-07-22**: The "Custom" preset name in Tweakpane should persist even after switching effects and coming back. Currently, it resets to "Default".
- **2024-07-22**: Consider adding a visual indicator for the auto-play timer, perhaps a subtle pause/play icon.
